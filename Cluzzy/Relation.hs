-- | 'Relation' is the type which represents binary relation in fuzzy logic.
-- It is simply represented as matrix with each value being the degree of
-- membership of the respective (row number, column number) pair (0..100).
-- For convenience, common lists and 'Int's were used. However, switching to
-- another base type (ex. some of the rich <https://goo.gl/qR24GH datakinds>
-- that CÎ»aSH provides in its <http://goo.gl/NfuByM Vec> module.
type Relation = [[Int]]


-- | 'fromSets' is a helper function which defines a 'Relation' based on two
-- input 'FuzzySet's. It is very basic at best, returning a naive
-- representation of what the result might look like.

-- at the Show instance for 'SpeedF'.
